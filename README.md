## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have. }_

_For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.

For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".

If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!

For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant._
